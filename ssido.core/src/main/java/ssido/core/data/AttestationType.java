     * In this case, an authenticator is based on a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and holds an authenticator-specific
     * "endorsement key" (EK). This key is used to securely communicate with a trusted third party, the Attestation CA
     * (formerly known as a "Privacy CA"). The authenticator can generate multiple attestation identity key pairs (AIK)
     * and requests an Attestation CA to issue an AIK certificate for each. Using this approach, such an authenticator
     * can limit the exposure of the EK (which is a global correlation handle) to Attestation CA(s). AIKs can be
     * requested for each authenticator-generated public key credential individually, and conveyed to Relying Parties as
     * attestation certificates.
     * <p>
     * Note: This concept typically leads to multiple attestation certificates. The attestation certificate requested
     * most recently is called "active".

     * attestation statement.
